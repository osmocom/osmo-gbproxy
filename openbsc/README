About OpenBSC
=============

OpenBSC is a minimalistic implementation of the GSM Network, with
particular emphasis on the functionality typically provided by the BSC,
MSC, HLR, VLR and SMSC.

Its currently supported interfaces towards the BTS are:

 * Classic A-bis over E1 using a mISDN based E1 interface. In other
   words, you can connect existing GSM Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
   through E1 to OpenBSC.  So far, we have only tested the Siemens BS-11
   Test reports with other BTS are much appreciated!

 * A-bis over IP as used by the ip.access nanoBTS product family

You can find the project documentation at http://openbsc.gnumonks.org/

This project is still in its early days, and there are lots of areas where it
doesn't behave as per GSM spec.

libosmocore
===========

Please note that as of March 2010, OpenBSC has a dependency to a library
called "libosmocore".  You can obtain that library from

	git://git.osmocom.org/libosmocore.git
