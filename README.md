About osmo-gbproxy
==================

osmo-gbproxy is a proxy for the Gb interface within the 3GPP GERAN (GPRS/EDGE RAN)
architecture. It is part of the [Osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) Open Source
Mobile Communications projects.

It allows you to aggregate many Gb links/connections into one. It also
has the ability to convert between different Gb interface protocol
stacking, such as from Gb-over-FrameRelay to Gb-over-IP.

Until 2021 it used to be part of the osmo-sgsn git repository, and before that
(until 2017) part of openbsc.git
